I am a Machine Learning Engineer at Bosch, where I am working on autonomous driving solutions using machine learning and computer vision.

I am doing my last year of Masters at Babeș-Bolyai University in Machine Learning. My interests include computer graphics and machine learning. Currently, I am working on my dissertation.
